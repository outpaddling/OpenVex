One limitation of the VEX system is the lack of a wireless connection.
The standard VEX hardware communicates with the PC through an RS232 serial
port.

In theory, a wireless connection to the VEX is possible using a bluetooth
serial extender.  Some such extenders require no software, but are simply
inserted into a DB-9 or similar serial connection, acting as a wireless
serial extension cable.

One example (which I have NOT tested) is the SENA Parani:

The capabilities of serial-bluetooth adapters varies, so be careful
which one you buy.
