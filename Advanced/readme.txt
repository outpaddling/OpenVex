This sample code is intended to demonstrate most of the common features
of the OpenVex library.  As such, it has many options for drive
mechanisms and implements, as well as autonomous mode routines.

Portions of code are disabled (preprocessed out) using manifest constants
in sample_code.h (ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_ROUTINES, DRIVE_ROUTINE).

If you're new to C programming or to Vex, you may want to start in
../Beginner, which contains a simpler program without all the bells
and whistles.
