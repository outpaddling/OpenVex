For detailed information on PIC programming, see the Microchip
spec sheet 39609b.pdf.

For information in the VEX architecture, this code is unfortunately the
best documentation available.

See io.h for information on how the PIC pins map to I/O and interrupt ports.

The PWM ports are controlled by the master processor.  ( This code runs
on the user processor. )  The two processors communicate over an SPI bus
every 18.5ms.  The source code to handle this communication is all in the
Lib directory.
