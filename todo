High priority
-------------
Continue to improve dox.

Look at sequence of low-priority ISR
    Process most likely/numerous interrupts first

New 2-wire motors + 29 controllers do not respond
    Old motor works fine on same port with same code
    Ruled out:
	compiler:   same problem with sdcc and mcc18
	master code:    works with easyC and starter code
	closed-source:  works with VexCode_unix
    checked init_regs()
	looks OK
    Ideas:
	SPI packet transmission corrupt?
	Other communication from user to master proc?
	    pins asserted to control PWM format?


Low priority
------------
Improve accuracy of delay_msec() and delay_sec() by accounting for
function call and loop overhead.

Create an API for the secondary usart.

sdcc: T0CON structure missing from pic1848520.h

timer0 write operations inhibit increment for 2 cycles.  Work around
by writing N+2.

sdcc?: pic18f8520.h has TMR2ON in T4CONbits
